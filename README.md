# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Repo For the Coursera Data Cleaning Class project

# General direction
This repo contains everything needed to run and review the run_analysis.R script prepared for the Data Cleaning Course for Coursera

The script will check for the existence of the UCI HAR Dataset directory, in the current directory.
If the directory does not exist it will attempt to download the file and unzip it.
It is assumed that none of the subfolders are modified and that the files are not moved around, as there is no seach logic built in.
Once the folder is found the analysis is perfomed.

1-The features and labels are stored <br>
2-The features are subset to only keep those with "mean" and "std" in the name
3-Activity and Test Data is loaded for the above features
4-All the data is merged and then turned into factors
5-Finally only the means are kept and written to a file as requested
